# Risk Detection System - Week 1 AI Hackathon

## Project Overview
This repository documents my participation in the Week 1 AI Hackathon where our team developed a Risk Detection System that analyzes Slack conversations to identify potential risks that might be buried or downplayed in engineering discussions.

## Live Application
The live application can be accessed here: [Risk Escalator App](https://risk-escalator.streamlit.app/)

## My Contributions
As a team member on this project, I contributed to:
- The brainstorming for the project solutions
- Developing risk detection algorithms
- Implementing sentiment analysis functionality
- Testing with sample Slack conversations
- Documenting the system capabilities and fine tuning the prompt

## System Features
Our Risk Detection System includes:
- Sentiment analysis of Slack messages
- Risk detection algorithms with keyword monitoring
- Data processing for CSV uploads of conversation data
- Interactive reporting through three main views:
  - Escalation Report
  - Visualizations
  - Insights

## Required Data Format
The system processes CSV files containing:
- `timestamp`: When the message was sent
- `sender`: Who sent the message
- `channel`: Which channel the message was sent in
- `message`: The content of the message

## Technologies Used
- Streamlit for the web application interface
- AI tools for sentiment analysis and risk detection
- Data visualization libraries
- Replit for App Development

## Learning Outcomes
This hackathon challenged me to apply AI tools to solve complex business problems under time constraints. The experience enhanced my skills in natural language processing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization while demonstrating practical applications of AI in business communication contexts.

## Course Context
This project is part of my portfolio for the AI Business Integration course, where we develop solutions for high-stakes business challenges using AI tools to deliver rapid, creative, and effective results.
