# Week 2 Hack: Meeting Optimization AI System

## Project Overview
An intelligent system that analyzes meeting effectiveness and provides actionable recommendations to reduce wasted time. The system scores past meetings on usefulness (were decisions made? were action items assigned?) and suggests which meetings could be handled asynchronously.

## Live Application
[Meeting Optimization AI System](https://v0-meeting-optimization-ai.vercel.app/)

## Challenge Background
- **Real-World Inspiration**: In 2022, Shopify deleted 12,000 calendar events in a single day, saving over 300,000 hours with no productivity drop.
- **Problem**: Most professionals attend numerous low-value meetings without agendas or clear outcomes.
- **Solution**: Our AI scores meetings on usefulness and suggests improvements or alternatives for low-value meetings.

## Key Features
1. **Meeting Classification Engine** - Categorizes meetings using titles and metadata
2. **Effectiveness Scoring Algorithm** - Scores meetings based on decisions made, action items assigned, and participation
3. **Data Visualization Dashboard** - Provides insights into meeting patterns
4. **Recommendation Engine** - Suggests improvements or alternatives for low-value meetings
5. **File Processing** - Processes input files with meeting data to generate analysis

For this Meeting Optimization AI project, I contributed in several key areas:

- Implemented the file processing functionality to handle meeting data input in CSV format
- Developed the scoring algorithm that evaluates meeting effectiveness based on decisions made and action items assigned
- Created visualizations to display meeting patterns and effectiveness metrics
- Designed the recommendation engine that suggests which meetings could be handled asynchronously
- Collaborated on the user interface to ensure intuitive data presentation
- Tested the system with various meeting datasets to validate accuracy
- Documented the system capabilities and implementation details

## Technologies Used
- React for the frontend interface
- AI integration for meeting analysis
- Data visualization libraries
